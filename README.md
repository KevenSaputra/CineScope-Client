# CineScope
A web application that aggregates and links to movie reviews and ratings from websites such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and YouTube, discussions from websites such as Reddit, and websites to see showtimes and buy tickets such as Fandango and AMC. Additionally, one can add movies to Favorites, Watched, and Watch Later lists and rate and write their own reviews for them. Additionally, the app can be linked to one’s Facebook account and the user will be able to see their friends’ Favorites, Watched, and Watch Later movie lists and be able to see their personal ratings and reviews for them. Of course, there will be privacy settings so one can limit who sees their lists, ratings, and reviews.
